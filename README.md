# 3-Layer-LSTM-Model-for-Detection-of-Epileptic-Seizures
An electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the ancillary methods to record the signals generated by the brain's electrical activity. Conventionally, neurologists scrutinize these EEG signals to identify neurological abnormalities like epilepsy. Such a way of observation is too time-consuming and requires proficiency. Therefore, a computer-aided diagnosis(CAD) system is needed to automatically discriminate the class of these EEG signals. This paper employs long short-term memory (LSTM) to analyze EEG signals. Herein, the LSTM model, which has only three layers, is presented. This model achieved 98.5% accuracy distinguishing between non-seizures and seizures in only 30 epochs. The number of layers and epochs is this work's main attraction, making this a valuable model for real-time detection.
